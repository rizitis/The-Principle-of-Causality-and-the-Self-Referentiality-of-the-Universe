# Theory of the Causal Origin and Self-Referentiality of the Universe

![epilogi](./1.png)

Description

This project presents a theoretical exploration of the Causal Origin and the Self-Referentiality of the Universe. According to the proposed theory, the universe is caused by an unknown external source, a source that possessed all the information from the very beginning and transmitted it to the universe. Since then, the universe has evolved to be self-referential and selective, following the principles of quantum choice.

The work investigates how causality, which originates from an external source, continues within the universe through self-referential loops and how quantum mechanics and the collapse of the wave function contribute to the selective nature of reality.
Key Points of the Theory:

    The universe's origin is external and unknown, and it contains all information from the start.
    The universe became self-referential after this transmission of information.
    The universe operates based on quantum choice, meaning the decisions of the system are shaped by quantum mechanics and quantum observation.
